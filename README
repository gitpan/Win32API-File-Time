Win32API::File::Time

This package exposes the Windows file creation time for access and
modification. It also allows the access, update, and creation times
to be modified even if the file is open, or read-only. In fact, the
porting of functionality from a system where the Perl utime build-in
would change the date of an open file (VMS) to one where it wouldn't
(MSWin32) was the motivation for the module.

This module exports nothing by default, but is capable of exporting
the following subroutines:
    GetFileTime and SetFileTime (to get and set all file times)
    utime (to override the built-in).
Unlike the Microsoft Kernel32 subroutines of the same name, these take
a file name (not a handle), and work in terms of Perl times, not
Microsoft file times. Specifically:

  ($atime, $mtime, $ctime) = GetFileTime ($filename);
  SetFileTime ($filename, $atime, $mtime, $ctime) or die $^E;

This module has the following prerequisites:
  Time::Local
  Win32::API
  Win32API::File
